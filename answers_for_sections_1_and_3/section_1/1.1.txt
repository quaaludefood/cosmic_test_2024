Question 1.1: How to properly track errors in:

● Bash, when you call other Unix commands

 - Bash commands exit with a status of 0 if successful or > 0 if there was an error. This error status can be printed in the terminal with:
 echo $?

 - Errors can also be captured in a text file with the following command (2 is the code of a standard error)
 YOUR COMMAND 2> errors.txt


● Python script

- Python functions raise an exception which can be captured in a try-catch statement and printed to the terminal i.e. (n.b. it is not good coding practice to 
have a catch-all statement for exceptions, rather capture and handle individual types of exceptions individually)

e.g:

try:
    ....your code here

except Exception as e:
    raise e 

Python has an in-built logging module which can be configured to write events such as errors to a file


● Perl script

I'm not familiar enough with perl to give an informed answer for this. Presumably there is a way to capture STDOUT and STDERR messages and write them to a log file.



● Database command line tool, sqlplus for Oracle or psql for PostgreSQL

I'm not familiar enough with the database command line to give an informed answer for this.
