Question 1.3: Why the code comment is important in Bash? And how to give proper comments in a Bash script?

Code comments are important because they provide teams of software developers in-line documentation as to the function of specific lines of code.

Bash comments are prefixed with the '#' symbol which the complier will ignore at run-time.

It may also be helpful to print information to the terminal when a function starts and ends to allow developers to monitor its progress, e.g.


#!/bin/bash
my_process () {
   start_time=$(date '+%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S');
    echo "my_process started: $dt"
    .... 
    finished_time=$(date '+%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S');
    echo "my_process finished: $dt"

}
